Frizzer
=======

A coverage-guided blackbox fuzzer based on the frida instrumentation framework.


Installation
------------

The fuzzer is written in Python 3 and depends on the python module `frida-tools`.
It is recommended to set up a Python virtual environment:

    $ git clone https://cis.ernw.net/dmantz/frida-fuzzer
    $ cd frida-fuzzer
    $ virtualenv3 venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install -e .
    $ frizzer --help



Usage
-----

A detailed usage description is still TODO ;)
This is also because the usage and configuration will change significantly
with the next commits..

Have a look at the test cases to get an idea how to use the fuzzer!
